# Title
Editable Image Segmentation via Convolutional Neural Network 

## Team members
Gaoping Huang (gaopinghuang0), Meng-Han Wu (wumenghan)

## Goals
Our goal is to first segment image via CNN, then convert the segmentation into editable and reusable components, and finally convert back to an image after users' edition as new training data.

## Challenges
1. Image Segmentation via CNN
2. How to convert segmentation into editable and reusable components?
3. How to deal with background after adjusting the components (e.g., how to deal with holes after removing the component)?

## Work partition
* Challenge 1: Work together
* Challenge 2: Gaoping Huang
* Challenge 3: Meng-Han Wu
